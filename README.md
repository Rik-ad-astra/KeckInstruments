# KeckInstruments

This module is intended to create simple python scripts for Keck instrument control and simple data analysis.  The analysis functions are intended to be used only as feedback related to instrument control, not proper science analysis.

The instruments currently implemented are:
* MOSFIRE
* HIRES
